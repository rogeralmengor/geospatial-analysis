## Usage

Each language-specific folder contains the corresponding implementation of the geospatial functions. Developers can explore the specific language they prefer to work with. Additionally, the Geopackage folder provides geopackage-related code, documentation, and examples.

## Algorithms
### Zonal Statistics
The Zonal Statistics algorithm calculates statistical summaries of raster values within predefined zones defined by vector geometries. It supports various statistical measures such as mean, sum, maximum, minimum, etc.

To use the zonal statistics function, provide the raster data and the vector data as input, along with the desired statistic. The function will return the calculated statistics for each zone.

### Spatial Interpolation
Spatial Interpolation techniques estimate values at unmeasured locations based on known data points. Common techniques include kriging, inverse distance weighting, and spline interpolation. These methods are useful for creating continuous surfaces from discrete geospatial data.

### Network Analysis
Network Analysis algorithms enable operations like shortest path calculation, network routing, and connectivity analysis on a network representation. These algorithms are helpful for analyzing transportation networks, utility networks, and other network-based systems.

### Spatial Clustering
Spatial Clustering algorithms group spatial data points based on their proximity or similarity. Popular clustering algorithms include k-means, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), and hierarchical clustering. These algorithms can assist in identifying spatial patterns and grouping related features.

### Geostatistics
Geostatistics involves analyzing and modeling spatial autocorrelation and spatial variability. It includes techniques like semivariogram modeling, which characterizes the spatial dependence structure, and spatial regression, which models spatial relationships between variables.
